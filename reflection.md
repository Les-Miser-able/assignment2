GITHUB REPO AND COMMIT REFLECTION:

Setting up Git and a GitHub repository was both a challenging and rewarding experience. At first, I struggled with understanding the different commands, especially when it came to initializing a repository, setting up remotes, and handling errors.

For example, I encountered issues when trying to push to GitHub because my local branch didnâ€™t match the remote branch name. It took some time to learn the difference between main and master, and how to properly rename or push a branch. Configuring Git with my name and email was a bit on the easy side, and activating a virtual environment for my Django project wasn't too difficult as we were taught how to open it. However, these challenges forced me to carefully read documentation, experiment with commands, and understand the workflow more deeply. In the end, overcoming these obstacles gave me a stronger grasp of Git fundamentals and more confidence in using version control effectively.
